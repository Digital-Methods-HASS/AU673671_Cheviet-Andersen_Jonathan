## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r libraries, echo = FALSE}
## install.packages("gganimate")
## install.packages("gifski")
## install.packages("av")
## install.packages("gapminder",repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
library(tidyverse)
library(gganimate)
library(gifski)
library(av)
library(gapminder)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
str(gapminder)
unique(gapminder$year)
head(gapminder)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


The dataset contains information on each country in the sampled year, its continent, life expectancy, population, and GDP per capita.

Let's plot all the countries in 1952.
```{r 1957}
theme_set(theme_bw())  # set theme to white background for better visibility

ggplot(subset(gapminder, year == 1952), aes(gdpPercap, lifeExp, size = pop)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_log10() 

```


1. *Why does it make sense to have a log10 scale on x axis?*
So we can see if a point is special. 
2. *Who is the outlier (the richest country in 1952 - far right on x axis)?* 
```{r}
gapminder %>%
  filter(year == 1952) %>%
  select(country, gdpPercap) %>%
  arrange(desc(gdpPercap))
```
Next, you can generate a similar plot for 2007 and compare the differences
```{r 2007}
ggplot(subset(gapminder, year == 2007), aes(gdpPercap, lifeExp, size = pop)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_log10() 
```

The black bubbles are a bit hard to read, the comparison would be easier with a bit more visual differentiation.

Tasks:

3. *Differentiate the **continents** by color, and fix the axis labels and units to be more legible (**Hint**: the 2.50e+08 is so called "scientific notation", which you might want to eliminate)*
```{r}
ggplot(subset(gapminder, year == 2007), aes(gdpPercap, lifeExp, size = pop)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = continent)) +
  scale_x_log10()  
  options(scipen=999)
```


4. *What are the five richest countries in the world in 2007?*
```{r}
gapminder %>%
  filter(year == 2007) %>%
  select(country, gdpPercap) %>%
  arrange(desc(gdpPercap)) %>%
  head(5)
```


5. *Can you add a title to one or both of the animations above that will change* 
 *in sync with the animation?* *(**Hint**: search labeling for `transition_states()` and `transition_time()` functions respectively)*
```{r anim2}
anim2 <- ggplot(gapminder, aes(gdpPercap, lifeExp, size = pop)) +
  geom_point(aes(color= continent)) +
  scale_x_log10() + # convert x to log scale
  transition_time(year) +
  ggtitle("Min graf") +
  transition_time(year, range= NULL)
anim2
```

6. *Can you made the axes' labels and units more readable? Consider expanding the abreviated lables as well as the scientific notation in the legend and x axis to whole numbers.*
```{r}
anim2 <- ggplot(gapminder, aes(gdpPercap, lifeExp, size = pop)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_log10() + # convert x to log scale
  transition_time(year) +
  ggtitle("Min graf") +
  xlab("GDP, indkomst") +
  ylab("Gennemsnitsalder") +
  transition_time(year, range= NULL)
anim2
```


7. *Come up with a question you want to answer using the gapminder data and write it down. Then, create a data visualisation that answers the question and explain how your visualization answers the question. (Example: you wish to see what was mean life expectancy across the continents in the year you were born versus your parents' birth years). [Hint: if you wish to have more data than is in the filtered gapminder, you can load either the `gapminder_unfiltered` dataset and download more at https://www.gapminder.org/data/ ]*

# What will be the best country to be born in, in the year of 1987? 


```{r, gapminder}
gapminder2 <- gapminder %>%
  mutate(lifemoneyindex = gdpPercap*lifeExp) %>% 
  select(country,lifemoneyindex, year) %>%
  filter(year==1987) %>% 
  arrange(desc(lifemoneyindex)) %>% 
  head(5)
```

head(gapminder2)
```{r}
ggplot(subset(gapminder2), aes(lifemoneyindex, year)) +
  geom_point(aes(x = year, y = lifemoneyindex)) + 
  ggtitle("Best place to be born") + xlab("Years (1952-2007)") + ylab("lifemoneyindex") + 
  scale_x_log10() 
```
